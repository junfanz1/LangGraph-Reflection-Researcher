answer: |-
  DeepSeek MoE and GRPO are not specifically recognized frameworks or models within the broad and rapidly evolving domain of AI research as of my last update. Given the dynamic nature of the AI field, the exact terms 'DeepSeek MoE' (Mixture of Experts) and 'GRPO' might refer to novel concepts, technologies, or methodologies introduced after my last update. However, based on the terms used, we can infer possible implications and applications in AI research that similar technologies could have.

  Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are a type of ensemble learning technique where multiple expert models contribute to solving parts of a problem, with a gating mechanism to decide which expert to use for each task. MoE models can significantly enhance performance in complex tasks by leveraging the specialized knowledge of each expert. If 'DeepSeek MoE' refers to an advanced implementation or application of MoE, its impact on AI could be substantial, offering more efficient, scalable, and precise solutions to intricate problems across domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

  'GRPO' might indicate a novel optimization or policy learning approach in the context of reinforcement learning or another area. If related to optimizing the performance of AI models or decision-making processes, such a methodology could improve learning efficiency, adaptability, and effectiveness in AI applications ranging from autonomous systems to personalized AI services.

  Both these technologies could push the boundaries of AI research, fostering innovations that make AI systems more capable, resource-efficient, and tailored to complex tasks and environments.
reflection:
  missing: The answer does not specify any concrete details about DeepSeek MoE and GRPO owing to their apparent non-existence within the currently available knowledge. It lacks specific information about their origins, creators, technical mechanisms, or documented use cases.
  superfluous: The theoretical discussion about Mixture of Experts (MoE) models and the speculation about 'GRPO' might be considered unnecessary in light of the question's presumed focus on actual, identifiable technologies or research findings related to 'DeepSeek MoE' and 'GRPO'.

    content: AWS | Community | Deep dive into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) However, as models grow larger and tasks become more complex, PPO's limitations—such as memory overhead and computational cost—have prompted the development of more advanced methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The final stage uses reinforcement learning to optimize the model's policy (π_θ) using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Now, PPO is a policy gradient method that optimizes a policy π_ø by maximizing a surrogate objective function (in this case, the approximate human preference/reward function). The group relative way that GRPO leverages to calculate the advantages, aligns well with the comparative nature of rewards models, as reward models are typically trained on datasets of comparisons between outputs on the same question.

<!-- TOC --><a name="tool_executorpy"></a>
### `tool_executor.py`

* **Purpose:** Integrates Tavily web search capabilities into a LangGraph `ToolNode` for use in a reflection agent.
* **Functionality:**
    * Initializes the Tavily Search API using `TavilySearchAPIWrapper` and `TavilySearchResults`.
    * Defines Pydantic models (`Reflection`, `AnswerQuestion`, `ReviseAnswer`) for structured data handling.
    * Creates a `run_queries` function to execute Tavily search queries in batches using `tavily_tool.batch()`.
    * Constructs a LangGraph `ToolNode` using `StructuredTool.from_function()` to convert the `run_queries` function into LangChain tools, specifically for `AnswerQuestion` and `ReviseAnswer` models.

<!-- TOC --><a name="10-how-it-works"></a>
## 10. How it Works

1.  The user provides a query: inputs a natural language question or request into the system (e.g., "Write about DeepSeek MoE and GRPO, list its impact and applications to future AI research."). This query is the starting point for the agent's research and refinement process.
2.  Initialization and Graph Execution: The `main.py` script initializes the LangGraph, which begins at the "first_responder" node.
3.  The "first_responder" node uses the `first_responder` chain from `chains.py` to generate an initial answer using the OpenAI LLM. This answer is formatted according to the `AnswerQuestion` schema.
4.  The output from the "first_responder" node is passed to the "execute_tools" node.
5.  The "execute_tools" node uses the `tool_node` from `tool_executor.py` to:
    * Extract search queries from the LLM's output, which are formatted according to the `AnswerQuestion` or `ReviseAnswer` schema.
    * Execute these queries in parallel using the Tavily Search API, via the `run_queries` function.
    * The `tool_node` encapsulates the `run_queries` function, allowing it to be used within the LangGraph workflow.
6.  The search results are passed to the "revise" node.
7.  The "revise" node uses the `revisor` chain from `chains.py` to refine the initial answer based on the search results and generate a critique. The refined answer is formatted according to the `ReviseAnswer` schema.
8.  The `event_loop` function in `main.py` determines the next step:
    * If the maximum number of iterations has been reached, the process ends.
    * Otherwise, the process returns to the "execute_tools" node for another iteration.
9.  The process repeats steps 5-8 until the maximum number of iterations is reached.
10. The final refined answer is returned as the output.

### LangGraph Researcher Agent
https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher
- Implementing agent production-ready. There’re nodes and edges, but no cycles. We can integrate GPT Researcher (as a node under LangGraph graph) within Multi-Agent Architecture. (https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher/tree/master/multi_agents)
- Every agent in a multi-agent system can be a researcher, as part of workflow. e.g., `Technology` agent is talor-made for technological subjects, and is dynamically created/chosen
- Research automation needs to make a decision for a few deeper levels and iterate again again again until the optimal answer. Key difference here is not only width (in parallel then aggregation) but also depth

<!-- TOC --><a name="reason-for-langgraph-in-multi-agent-architecture"></a>
### Reason for LangGraph in Multi-Agent Architecture
- LangGraph (Flow Engineering techniques addresses the tradeoff between agent freedom and our control) is more flexible in production than CrewAI (doesn’t have as much control of the flow)
- Breaks down the problem into specific actions, like microservices, (1) with specialized tasks, we can control quality of nodes, (2) can scale up the application as it grows
- Customizability, creative framework
- Contextual compression is the best method for retrieving in RAG workflow
- Allow both web and local data indexing, with LangChain easy integration can embed anything
- Human-in-the-loop, let user decide how much feedback autonomy to interact with, especially useful when finding two knowledge sources that conflict or contradict each other. When this happens, AI needs human assistance.
